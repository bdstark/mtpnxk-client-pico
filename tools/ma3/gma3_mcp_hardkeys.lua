-- gma3_mcp_hardkeys.lua
--
-- Instance-based console input module for grandMA3 onPC plugins.
--
-- What this file is:
--   A ComponentLua of a UserPlugin. The console runs this chunk once when the plugin is imported or
--   reloaded; the chunk only builds and returns a module table. It touches no console API, creates no
--   socket, timer or show object and sends no input when it is loaded or when an instance is created.
--   Consumers ship it as a ComponentLua of their own plugin (see docs/modules.md): the chunk registers
--   the module in the plugin's signal table, the entry component looks it up and calls new(). The
--   source travels inside the show file; no loose file is needed on the console.
--
-- What this version provides (MODULE API 1, module version 0.5.0, KB-03 + KB-04 + KB-05; 0.5.0 adds
-- shortcut-table resolution of any Enums.VirtualKeyCode name for surface consumers, KB-07):
--   * explicit instance lifecycle: new() -> init() -> service(now) ... -> dispose(now)
--   * owned input sessions with leases: openSession / renewSession / closeSession. Every held key
--     belongs to a session; the consumer binds sessions to whatever identifies its clients (the bridge
--     binds them to TCP connections) and never accepts a session id from an untrusted caller.
--   * press / tap / combo / release / releaseAll / recover on a backend adapter. Two adapters dispatch:
--     the FAKE backend (fakeBackend(); records events, simulates aggregate key state, touches no key)
--     and, since KB-04, the KEYBOARD backend (keyboardBackend(deps); the console's Keyboard() PC-key
--     emulation with explicit per-event modifiers, routed through the operator's shortcut table or a
--     verified native route). The adapter only dispatches validated events and observes; ownership,
--     leases, deadlines and recovery stay in this lifecycle.
--   * stored press tuples: each hold keeps the resolved PC key, modifier flags, display, logical key,
--     the route it was pressed with (shortcut text, row, profile, enablement, or the native route) and
--     the name of the backend that pressed it. Release always uses that stored tuple on that backend.
--     Nothing is ever re-resolved to release a hold, and a record from one backend is never released
--     through another.
--   * release-result semantics: an attempt is CONFIRMED (the backend observed the key up), DISPATCHED
--     (the call returned; the effect is not observable per key on this backend) or UNRESOLVED (refused,
--     raised, route changed, or the backend reports the key still down). Keyboard() releases are
--     "dispatched"; the aggregate MASTATE readback is reported separately and never turned into a
--     per-key confirmation or failure.
--   * deadline servicing without sleeps: service(now) releases taps and expired leases, a bounded
--     number of attempts per call, takes the backend's console-state snapshot and completes bounded
--     readbacks (MASTATE after an MA press/release) for status().
--   * recovery: a release that fails, or that cannot be confirmed after the route changed, leaves the
--     hold in the "unresolved" state. The record is kept (and still blocks conflicting presses) until
--     a recover() attempt succeeds. dispose() hands unresolved records back so a consumer can keep
--     them across a restart and adopt() them into a new instance. attachBackend() attaches an adapter
--     for cleanup without admitting new presses.
--   * status(now): read-only. It performs no cleanup and calls nothing on the backend; the observed
--     console state it reports is the snapshot taken by the last service().
--   * interactions (KB-05): beginInteraction / renewInteraction / endInteraction give a session an
--     explicit, leased ownership token for a complete interaction. While an interaction is open, while
--     a sequence runs and while any key is held, admission(now) reports the instance as BUSY; the
--     consumer refuses conflicting mutations (commands, property changes, playback, faders, arbitrary
--     Lua) from every connection with that descriptor instead of delaying them into a changed context.
--     A standalone hold (press, combo without holdMs) needs an open interaction and its id on every
--     call, so callers sharing one connection cannot accidentally act on each other's holds; bounded
--     taps and sequences may run without one. Interactions are never resumed: an id from a closed,
--     expired or disconnected session is refused.
--   * text (KB-05): the adapter's char(codepoint, display) event. Text is validated as UTF-8 and
--     iterated by code point; control characters (tab, newline, C0/C1, DEL, line separators) are
--     refused, so text can never execute, change focus or toggle shortcuts. It needs an explicit
--     context: "command-line" (admitted only while the operator has disabled keyboard shortcuts,
--     with a bounded CmdObj().cmdtext readback) or "text-field" (focus is not observable; the caller
--     acknowledges it and UI verification is reported unavailable). Text is typed in chunks by
--     service(), the context is rechecked between chunks and typing stops with its progress when it
--     changes. Committing text (PLEASE/Enter) is always a separate, explicit key event.
--   * sequences (KB-05): startSequence() validates every step (taps, presses, releases, combos, text,
--     waits) before the first event, then service() runs the steps one after another so tap releases,
--     leases and deadlines keep being serviced meanwhile. Each step ends completed, failed, uncertain
--     (a dispatch raised or a release stayed unresolved) or unattempted; a failure stops the sequence,
--     releases what it pressed and never replays anything. A sequence owns an interaction (given or
--     begun for it) and at most one runs per instance.
--
-- Ownership semantics (KB-01/KB-03 findings): the console's key state is shared. A physical release
-- can end a synthetic hold and MASTATE is aggregate, so an ownership record here means "this session is
-- responsible for releasing this tuple", not "the key is down because of us". The module never
-- re-presses a key because the console no longer reports it down.
--
-- Interaction semantics (KB-04): an EXCLUSIVE hold (spec.exclusive, the intended long-press) rejects
-- every new press from every session, including the owner's duplicate, until it is released, and is
-- itself refused while any other ownership record exists; releases stay allowed. A COMBO presses several
-- keys in order after every constituent key passed resolution, admission and the backend preflight;
-- nothing is dispatched if one fails, and a press that fails midway releases what was pressed. A
-- double-press is unsupported. Input is not display-scoped: the display argument is validated to exist
-- and passed to Keyboard() as API context only.
--
-- Rules every consumer must keep:
--   * One instance per consumer. Instances never share mutable state; the module table is read-only.
--   * Pass console dependencies through opts.deps (consoleDeps(_G) builds them lazily). The module
--     never reads globals, so it can be exercised under a stock Lua interpreter.
--   * Do not store an instance in a global and do not publish this module through package.loaded or
--     require(): that cache is shared by every plugin in the console and survives re-import.
--   * Input is disabled on a new instance. enableInput(adapter) is the operator's explicit decision.
