-- gma3_mcp_hardkeys.lua
--
-- Instance-based console input module for grandMA3 onPC plugins.
--
-- What this file is:
--   A ComponentLua of a UserPlugin. The console runs this chunk once when the plugin is imported or
--   reloaded; the chunk only builds and returns a module table. It touches no console API, creates no
--   socket, timer or show object and sends no input when it is loaded or when an instance is created.
--   Consumers ship it as a ComponentLua of their own plugin (see docs/modules.md): the chunk registers
--   the module in the plugin's signal table, the entry component looks it up and calls new(). The
--   source travels inside the show file; no loose file is needed on the console.
--
-- What this version provides (MODULE API 1, module version 0.5.0, KB-03 + KB-04 + KB-05; 0.5.0 adds
-- shortcut-table resolution of any Enums.VirtualKeyCode name and opts.prefer / spec.prefer to name the
-- row of a same-target tie, for surface consumers, KB-07):
--   * explicit instance lifecycle: new() -> init() -> service(now) ... -> dispose(now)
--   * owned input sessions with leases: openSession / renewSession / closeSession. Every held key
--     belongs to a session; the consumer binds sessions to whatever identifies its clients (the bridge
--     binds them to TCP connections) and never accepts a session id from an untrusted caller.
--   * press / tap / combo / release / releaseAll / recover on a backend adapter. Two adapters dispatch:
--     the FAKE backend (fakeBackend(); records events, simulates aggregate key state, touches no key)
--     and, since KB-04, the KEYBOARD backend (keyboardBackend(deps); the console's Keyboard() PC-key
--     emulation with explicit per-event modifiers, routed through the operator's shortcut table or a
--     verified native route). The adapter only dispatches validated events and observes; ownership,
--     leases, deadlines and recovery stay in this lifecycle.
--   * stored press tuples: each hold keeps the resolved PC key, modifier flags, display, logical key,
--     the route it was pressed with (shortcut text, row, profile, enablement, or the native route) and
--     the name of the backend that pressed it. Release always uses that stored tuple on that backend.
--     Nothing is ever re-resolved to release a hold, and a record from one backend is never released
--     through another.
--   * release-result semantics: an attempt is CONFIRMED (the backend observed the key up), DISPATCHED
--     (the call returned; the effect is not observable per key on this backend) or UNRESOLVED (refused,
--     raised, route changed, or the backend reports the key still down). Keyboard() releases are
--     "dispatched"; the aggregate MASTATE readback is reported separately and never turned into a
--     per-key confirmation or failure.
--   * deadline servicing without sleeps: service(now) releases taps and expired leases, a bounded
--     number of attempts per call, takes the backend's console-state snapshot and completes bounded
--     readbacks (MASTATE after an MA press/release) for status().
--   * recovery: a release that fails, or that cannot be confirmed after the route changed, leaves the
--     hold in the "unresolved" state. The record is kept (and still blocks conflicting presses) until
--     a recover() attempt succeeds. dispose() hands unresolved records back so a consumer can keep
--     them across a restart and adopt() them into a new instance. attachBackend() attaches an adapter
--     for cleanup without admitting new presses.
--   * status(now): read-only. It performs no cleanup and calls nothing on the backend; the observed
--     console state it reports is the snapshot taken by the last service().
--   * interactions (KB-05): beginInteraction / renewInteraction / endInteraction give a session an
--     explicit, leased ownership token for a complete interaction. While an interaction is open, while
--     a sequence runs and while any key is held, admission(now) reports the instance as BUSY; the
--     consumer refuses conflicting mutations (commands, property changes, playback, faders, arbitrary
--     Lua) from every connection with that descriptor instead of delaying them into a changed context.
--     A standalone hold (press, combo without holdMs) needs an open interaction and its id on every
--     call, so callers sharing one connection cannot accidentally act on each other's holds; bounded
--     taps and sequences may run without one. Interactions are never resumed: an id from a closed,
--     expired or disconnected session is refused.
--   * text (KB-05): the adapter's char(codepoint, display) event. Text is validated as UTF-8 and
--     iterated by code point; control characters (tab, newline, C0/C1, DEL, line separators) are
--     refused, so text can never execute, change focus or toggle shortcuts. It needs an explicit
--     context: "command-line" (admitted only while the operator has disabled keyboard shortcuts,
--     with a bounded CmdObj().cmdtext readback) or "text-field" (focus is not observable; the caller
--     acknowledges it and UI verification is reported unavailable). Text is typed in chunks by
--     service(), the context is rechecked between chunks and typing stops with its progress when it
--     changes. Committing text (PLEASE/Enter) is always a separate, explicit key event.
--   * sequences (KB-05): startSequence() validates every step (taps, presses, releases, combos, text,
--     waits) before the first event, then service() runs the steps one after another so tap releases,
--     leases and deadlines keep being serviced meanwhile. Each step ends completed, failed, uncertain
--     (a dispatch raised or a release stayed unresolved) or unattempted; a failure stops the sequence,
--     releases what it pressed and never replays anything. A sequence owns an interaction (given or
--     begun for it) and at most one runs per instance.
--   * routing policy (KB-11, 0.6.0): a consumer chooses one default dispatch METHOD and overrides it
--     per logical key (opts.routing at new(), configureRouting() later). Methods: quickkey, shortcut,
--     shortcutOrType, type. The decision is made and validated before dispatch, stored on the hold and
--     kept for the whole press/release cycle; an unavailable or refused route never selects another
--     method, and a configuration change never changes the route a live hold is released with.
--     describeRoute(name) reports the configured method, the effective route, the backend capabilities
--     and every unavailable requirement; status().routing summarises the policy. Callers without a
--     policy keep the pre-0.6.0 behaviour (method "shortcut"). Quickey tuples ({ quickkey = <code> })
--     need an adapter that advertises capabilities.quickkey (the fake does; the KB-13 backend will);
--     the text routes of shortcutOrType/type are dispatched since 0.9.0 (KB-14, below).
--   * scoped shortcut-mode changes and text routes (KB-14, 0.9.0): a shortcut-table route while
--     shortcuts are off (method shortcut) and the text routes (type, the text side of shortcutOrType)
--     are dispatched through a bounded MODE OPERATION: the active profile and the shortcut state are
--     captured (refused if unreadable), the state is written only when it differs from what the route
--     needs, verified by readback, kept for the whole lifecycle of every hold that depends on it and
--     restored by service() one restore delay after the last dependent event (never in the same call as
--     the last key event: the console consumes a modifier press on the next frame and discards it when
--     the mode is restored in the same chunk; disabling shortcuts also drops a held MA). Before the
--     restore the profile and the state are re-read: a changed profile or an unreadable state is
--     INTERFERENCE and the operation becomes an unresolved RESTORATION (status().modeChange, busy
--     reason "restoration") that blocks every new press until recover() verifies and restores it; a
--     replacement profile is never written, and a state the operator already set back is left alone.
--     Text routes insert the key's text once on press (chunked, the state rechecked between chunks,
--     partial progress reported, nothing replayed) and nothing on release; the record is "retained"
--     until the mode is restored (or "quarantined" when the restoration went unresolved) and refuses
--     every other instance-owned record meanwhile. Abrupt termination and changes nobody can observe
--     from Lua (another plugin writing the same property between two reads) defeat the guarantee.
--   * Quickey bank (KB-12, 0.7.0): provisionBank(spec, now) creates one owned Quickey per command-area
--     hardkey code in an operator-selected pool range and reserves an executor range for holds (KB-10:
--     press/release needs the Quickey on an executor). Codes are discovered from Enums.VirtualKeyCode,
--     aliases deduplicated, exclusions reported, and each code carries its KB-10 qualification.
--     Ownership is the marker written into the Quickey's Note plus the matching Code/Name, re-read
--     before every mutation and before every dispatch (bankTarget/bankExecutor); nothing is overwritten,
--     repaired or deleted unless it verifies, and nothing is created or deleted without
--     spec.authorized == true (the consumer's explicit operator decision). verifyBank() re-reads all,
--     service() marks the bank stale on a show/data-pool change, teardownBank() removes only verified
--     owned objects and refuses while Quickey records are live, dispose() hands the record back for
--     adoptBank(). A second owner on the same slots is rejected (no shared arbitration yet).
--   * owned-Quickey backend (KB-13, 0.8.0): quickeyBackend(instance) dispatches Quickey tuples through
--     the instance's bank. A Quickey addressed directly is always a complete tap (KB-10), so every tap,
--     hold and chord is an EXECUTOR press: right before the press the code's Quickey is re-read through
--     bankTarget(), a free reserved executor is re-read through bankExecutor(), the Quickey is assigned
--     to it when needed (verified by readback) and "Press Page P.E" is issued; the release issues
--     "Unpress Page P.E" on the RECORDED executor only, and only while it still holds the recorded
--     Quickey (index, marker, Code). Nothing is re-resolved for a release, a direct "Unpress Quickey"
--     is never issued (it re-activates non-latching keys), and an executor emptied, reassigned or
--     deleted during a hold leaves the record unresolved for the operator and recover(). The recorded
--     target travels with the hold (dispose() records, adopt()), so a restart releases through the
--     same executor. Only codes with KB-10 evidence are dispatched, each with its own tap/hold/chord
--     flags; discovered-only codes are refused before dispatch. No PC-key or text dispatch.
--   * mixed backend (KB-15, 0.10.0): mixedBackend({ quickey = <adapter>, keyboard = <adapter> }) serves
--     both kinds of tuple on one instance, so a consumer can default its keys to quickkey (after the
--     explicit KB-12 bank setup) and override single keys to shortcut / shortcutOrType / type. Each record
--     remembers the PART that pressed it (hold.backend = "quickey" | "keyboard"), so releases, restarts
--     and recover() go through the same part, and an unavailable Quickey route (no bank, discovered-only
--     code) stays a refusal: nothing falls back to Keyboard(). The two mechanisms press the console's own
--     keys and the shortcut mode is one profile property, and their interplay is NOT qualified, so the
--     instance refuses (unqualified-mix, on every backend) a Quickey next to a live PC-key record and the
--     reverse, a combo or sequence that would put both kinds down at once, a Quickey while a temporary
--     shortcut-mode change is active, and a mode change while a Quickey is down.
--
-- Ownership semantics (KB-01/KB-03 findings): the console's key state is shared. A physical release
-- can end a synthetic hold and MASTATE is aggregate, so an ownership record here means "this session is
-- responsible for releasing this tuple", not "the key is down because of us". The module never
-- re-presses a key because the console no longer reports it down.
--
-- Interaction semantics (KB-04): an EXCLUSIVE hold (spec.exclusive, the intended long-press) rejects
-- every new press from every session, including the owner's duplicate, until it is released, and is
-- itself refused while any other ownership record exists; releases stay allowed. A COMBO presses several
-- keys in order after every constituent key passed resolution, admission and the backend preflight;
-- nothing is dispatched if one fails, and a press that fails midway releases what was pressed. A
-- double-press is unsupported. Input is not display-scoped: the display argument is validated to exist
-- and passed to Keyboard() as API context only.
--
-- Rules every consumer must keep:
--   * One instance per consumer. Instances never share mutable state; the module table is read-only.
--   * Pass console dependencies through opts.deps (consoleDeps(_G) builds them lazily). The module
--     never reads globals, so it can be exercised under a stock Lua interpreter.
--   * Do not store an instance in a global and do not publish this module through package.loaded or
--     require(): that cache is shared by every plugin in the console and survives re-import.
--   * Input is disabled on a new instance. enableInput(adapter) is the operator's explicit decision.

-- Routing policy (KB-11, 0.6.0) ------------------------------------------------
--
-- A consumer chooses how its logical keys are dispatched: one default method plus per-key overrides.
-- The four methods of KEYBOARD.md ("Configurable hardkey dispatch and Quickey migration"):
--   quickkey        activate the owned Quickey carrying the key's VirtualKeyCode (KB-10 evidence). Needs
--                   an adapter advertising capabilities.quickkey (KB-13); the fake backend simulates it.
--   shortcut        resolve the key's shortcut-table/fixed/native route and press the PC key: the
--                   behaviour every caller had before 0.6.0 and the module default. A shortcut-table
--                   route while shortcuts are off temporarily enables them for the hold (KB-14, 0.9.0)
--                   when the backend can change the mode; otherwise it is refused, never toggled.
--   shortcutOrType  the shortcut route when shortcuts are positively enabled and resolution succeeds;
--                   the key's explicit text mapping when shortcuts are positively off, or when the table
--                   was read and confirms that no row maps the key (shortcuts are then temporarily
--                   disabled for the insertion). Unreadable state, ambiguity, collisions and admission
--                   failures refuse; they never select text.
--   type            the key's explicit text mapping, inserted once on press, with shortcuts temporarily
--                   disabled when they are on (KB-14, 0.9.0).
-- The method is decided and validated before dispatch and stored on the hold: a configuration or mode
-- change during a hold never changes the route its release uses, and an unavailable or refused route
-- never falls back to another method or backend.

-- Quickey bank (KB-12, 0.7.0) ----------------------------------------------------
--
-- One owned Quickey per command-area hardkey code, created in an operator-selected pool range, plus a
-- reserved executor range for holds: KB-10 established that a Quickey addressed directly is always a
-- complete tap, and that press/release needs the Quickey assigned to an executor (Press/Unpress
-- Executor). Provisioning, verification, teardown and adoption live here so that no surface writes its
-- own allocator. Rules:
--   * nothing is created, changed or deleted unless provisionBank()/teardownBank() are called with
--     spec.authorized == true, the consumer's explicit operator decision (the bridge takes it from the
--     plugin argument, never from a client request);
--   * ownership is proven by the marker the module wrote into the Quickey's Note (owner, bank id, code,
--     executor range) AND the matching Code/Name, re-read before every mutation and before every
--     dispatch; a label alone proves nothing, and an object that fails the check is refused, never
--     repaired or overwritten;
--   * preflight checks the complete reservation before the first object is created, and every target is
--     re-read right before it is mutated; preflight is not an atomic reservation against other plugins;
--   * a bank marked by another owner is refused (no shared arbitration in this version); a bank of the
--     same owner is reused only after identity, codes and configuration verified;
--   * codes are discovered from Enums.VirtualKeyCode at provisioning time (not a fixed count), aliases
--     are deduplicated and exclusions reported; each code carries its KB-10 qualification, and a code
--     without evidence is provisioned as DISCOVERED (qualified = false): a backend must not advertise it.

-- Quickey bank (KB-12) -------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- Console access goes through deps.quickeys / deps.executors / deps.showIdentity (consoleDeps builds
-- them; the harness fakes them). Every read is pcall'd; a raise is a failure of that step, never a
-- guess. Contract:
--   quickeys.read(index)  -> nil (empty slot) | { name, code, note, lock, class }
--   quickeys.create(index) / set(index, { Note, Code, Name }) / delete(index) -> true | false, err
--   executors.read(page, index) -> { exists, class, empty, object = { class, name, index, note, code } | nil }
--                                  (index/note/code of the assigned object when it is a Quickey)
--   executors.assign(page, index, quickeyIndex) / clear(page, index) -> true | false, err
--   showIdentity() -> string identifying the show file and data pool the objects live in
--
-- Reservation (review finding 3): an executor is reserved by assigning the bank's code-less PLACEHOLDER
-- Quickey ("MCP RESERVED", marker code=RESERVED, slot right after the codes) to it, so the claim is an
-- object on the console that any other consumer reads as a foreign marker; an empty executor is not a
-- reservation. Ownership of an assigned executor (finding 2) is the assigned Quickey's pool index, marker
-- (owner, bank id, code) and Code matching one of this bank's entries, never its name. Every target,
-- executor and teardown access (finding 1) re-reads the show identity first; a mismatch makes the bank
-- stale and refuses, and verifyBank() keeps it stale until the identity matches again.
